To address these challenges, we propose Motion Mamba, a\\nsimple and efficient approach that presents the pioneering motion generation\\nmodel utilized SSMs. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Temporal Mamba\\n(HTM) block to process temporal data by ensemble varying numbers of isolated\\nSSM modules across a symmetric U-Net architecture aimed at preserving motion\\nconsistency between frames. We also design a Bidirectional Spatial Mamba (BSM)\\nblock to bidirectionally process latent poses, to enhance accurate motion\\ngeneration within a temporal frame. Our proposed method achieves up to 50% FID\\nimprovement and up to 4 times faster on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets\\ncompared to the previous best diffusion-based method, which demonstrates strong\\ncapabilities of high-quality long sequence motion modeling and real-time human\\nmotion generation.

In this work, we address these gaps by 1) elaborating the first dataset\\npairing long textual descriptions and 3D complex motions (HumanLong3D), and 2)\\nproposing an autoregressive motion diffusion model (AMD). Specifically, AMD\\nintegrates the text prompt at the current timestep with the text prompt and\\naction sequences at the previous timestep as conditional information to predict\\nthe current action sequences in an iterative manner.

With this in mind, this paper proposes a new Emotion-enriched Text-to-Motion Generation (ETMG) task, aiming to generate motions with the subjective emotion information. Further, this paper believes that injecting emotions into limbs (named intra-limb emotion injection) and ensuring the coordination and coherence of emotional motions after injecting emotion information (named inter-limb emotion disturbance) is rather important and challenging in this ETMG task.

Specifically, this approach designs an LLM-guided intra-limb emotion modeling block to inject emotion into limbs, followed by a graph-structured inter-limb relation modeling block to ensure the coordination and coherence of emotional motions.

Detailed evaluation demonstrates the significant advantage of our L3EM approach to ETMG over the state-of-the-art baselines. This justifies the importance of the limb-level emotion information for ETMG and the effectiveness of our L3EM approach in coherently manipulating such information.\",\"authors\":[\"Tan Yu\",\"Jingjing Wang\",\"Jiawen Wang\",\"Jiamin Luo\",\"Guodong Zhou\"],\"year\":2024,\"month\":10,\"url\":\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3664647.3681487\",\"survey\":false,\"survey_abbr\":\"\",\"model\":true,\"model_abbr\":\"L3EM\",\"dataset\":true,\"dataset_abbr\":\"Limb-ET2M\",\"submission\":\"MM\",\"submission_year\":\"2024\",\"page\":\"\",\"repo\":\"https://github.com/aekx/L3EM\",\"backbone_tags\":\"CLIP, LLM, Diffusion\",\"approach_tags\":\"Graph\"},{\"arxiv_id\":\"non-arxiv5\",\"title\":\"M-Adaptor: Text-driven Whole-body Human Motion Generation\",\"abstract\":\"Text-driven whole-body human motion generation, which involves the creation of motion sequences based on textual descriptions, has attracted much attention in the communities of computer vision and artificial intelligence. It aims to extend text-driven motion generation tasks to accommodate complex whole-body human motions, encompassing facial expressions and hand gestures. Researchers have recently developed large-scale 3D expressive whole-body motion datasets enriched with semantic labels and pose descriptions. Nonetheless, there remains a considerable demand within the community for a straightforward and effective framework for generating and evaluating whole-body human motion based on textual descriptions. To address the above issues, we introduce M-Adaptor, a two-stage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based generator for whole-body motion generation tasks, to improve the quality and diversity of body motions, facial expressions, and hand gestures. In particular, it first generates initial coarse-grained body motion tokens from textual prompts to enhance the stability of generated motions, then iterates fine-grained facial expressions with the LoRA-based adaptor to enhance motion expressiveness. Furthermore, we extend the existing state-of-the-art CLaM model to CLaM-H and CLaM-X for evaluation of SMPL-H and SMPL-X based motion generation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our framework's superior performance, with a significant R-Precision improvement for text-driven whole-body motion generation.\",\"authors\":[\"Alicia Li\",\"Xiaodong Chen\",\"Bohao Liang\",\"Qian Bao\",\"Wu Liu\"],\"year\":2024,\"month\":11,\"url\":\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025W/PVUW/html/Li_M-Adaptor_Text-driven_Whole-body_Human_Motion_Generation_CVPRW_2025_paper.html\",\"survey\":false,\"survey_abbr\":\"\",\"model\":true,\"model_abbr\":\"M-Adaptor\",\"dataset\":false,\"dataset_abbr\":\"\",\"submission\":\"CVPR Workshop\",\"submission_year\":\"2025\",\"page\":\"\",\"repo\":\"\",\"backbone_tags\":\"Transformer\",\"approach_tags\":\"LoRA\"},{\"arxiv_id\":\"non-arxiv6\",\"title\":\"MotionGPT: Human Motion Synthesis with Improved Diversity and Realism via GPT-3 Prompting\",\"abstract\":\"There are numerous applications for human motion synthesis, including animation, gaming, robotics, or sports science. In recent years, human motion generation from natural language has emerged as a promising alternative to costly and labor-intensive data collection methods relying on motion capture or wearable sensors (e.g., suits). Despite this, generating human motion from textual descriptions remains a challenging and intricate task, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale supervised datasets capable of capturing the full diversity of human activity.This study proposes a new approach, called MotionGPT, to address the limitations of previous text-based human motion generation methods by utilizing the extensive semantic information available in large language models (LLMs). We first pretrain a doubly text-conditional motion diffusion model on both coarse (\\\"high-level\\\") and detailed (\\\"low-level\\\") ground truth text data. Then during inference, we improve motion diversity and alignment with the training set, by zero-shot prompting GPT-3 for additional \\\"low-level\\\" details. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art quantitative results in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and motion diversity metrics, and improves all considered metrics.

While recent notable advances have been made in generating common motions, existing methods struggle to generate diverse and rare motions due to the complexity of motions and limited training data. This work introduces ReMoGPT, a unified motion-language generative model that solves a wide range of motion-related tasks by incorporating a multi-modal retrieval mechanism into the generation process to address the limitations of existing models, namely diversity and generalizability. We propose to focus on body-part-level motion features to enable fine-grained text-motion retrieval and locate suitable references from the database to conduct generation. Then, the motion-language generative model is trained with prompt-based question-and-answer tasks designed for different motion-relevant problems. We incorporate the retrieved samples into the prompt, and then perform instruction tuning of the motion-language model, to learn from task feedback and produce promising results with the help of fine-grained multi-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of ReMoGPT, showcasing its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing approaches typically rely on supervised style learning with labeled datasets, constraining their adaptability and generalization for effective diverse style control. Additionally, they have not fully explored the temporal correlations between motion, textual descriptions, and style, making it challenging to generate semantically consistent motion with precise style alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel method that integrates unsupervised style from arbitrary references into a text-driven diffusion model to generate semantically consistent stylized human motion. The core innovation lies in leveraging text as a mediator to capture the temporal correspondences between motion and style, enabling the seamless integration of temporally dynamic style into motion features. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model on a text-motion dataset to capture the correlation between motion and text semantics. A style adapter then extracts temporally dynamic style features from reference motions and integrates a novel Semantic-Aware Style Injection (SASI) module to infuse these features into the diffusion model. The SASI module computes the semantic correlation between motion and style features based on texts, selectively incorporating style features that align with motion content, ensuring semantic consistency and precise style alignment. Our style adapter does not require a labeled style dataset for training, enhancing adaptability and generalization of style control. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of semantic consistency and style expressivity.\",\"authors\":[\"Linjun Wu\",\"Xiangjun Tang\",\"Jingyuan Cong\",\"He Wang\",\"Bo Hu\",\"Xu Gong\",\"Songnan Li\",\"Yuchen Liao\",\"Yiqian Wu\",\"Chen Liu\",\"Xiaogang Jin\"],\"year\":2025,\"month\":8,\"url\":\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3721238.3730641\",\"survey\":false,\"survey_abbr\":\"\",\"model\":true,\"model_abbr\":\"SASI\",\"dataset\":false,\"dataset_abbr\":\"\",\"submission\":\"SIGGRAPH\",\"submission_year\":\"2025\",\"page\":\"https://fivezerojun.github.io/stylization.github.io/\",\"repo\":\"\",\"backbone_tags\":\"UNet, CNN, Transformer, Diffusion\",\"approach_tags\":\"\"},{\"arxiv_id\":\"non-arxiv9\",\"title\":\"SPORT: From Zero-shot Prompts to Real-time Motion Generation\",\"abstract\":\"Real-time motion generation has garnered significant attention within the fields of computer animation and gaming.

SPORT consists of three primary components: (1) a body-part phase autoencoder that ensures smooth transitions between diverse motions; (2) a body-part content encoder that mitigates semantic gap between texts and motions; (3) a diffusion-based decoder that accelerates the denoising process while enhancing the diversity and realism of motions.

UniTMGE comprises three components: UTMV for mapping text and motion into a shared latent space using contrastive learning, a controllable diffusion model customized for the UTMV space, and MCRE for unifying multimodal conditions into CLIP representations, enabling precise multimodal control and flexible motion editing through simple linear operations.
