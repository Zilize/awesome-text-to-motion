To this end, we scale up a large\\nunconditional diffusion model up to 1B parameters, so as to utilize the massive\\nunlabeled motion data up to over 20M motion instances. At the subsequent\\nfine-tuning stage, we introduce motion ControlNet, which incorporates text\\nprompts as conditioning information, through a trainable copy of the\\npre-trained model and the proposed novel Mixture-of-Controllers (MoC) block.\\nMoC block adaptively recognizes various ranges of the sub-motions with a\\ncross-attention mechanism and processes them separately with the\\ntext-token-specific experts. Such a design effectively aligns the CLIP token\\nembeddings of text prompts to various ranges of compact and expressive motion\\nfeatures.

Diffusion models, which have already shown remarkable\\ngenerative capabilities in other domains, are promising candidates for human\\nmotion due to their many-to-many nature, but they tend to be resource hungry\\nand hard to control. In this paper, we introduce Motion Diffusion Model (MDM),\\na carefully adapted classifier-free diffusion-based generative model for the\\nhuman motion domain. MDM is transformer-based, combining insights from motion\\ngeneration literature. A notable design-choice is the prediction of the sample,\\nrather than the noise, in each diffusion step. This facilitates the use of\\nestablished geometric losses on the locations and velocities of the motion,\\nsuch as the foot contact loss. As we demonstrate, MDM is a generic approach,\\nenabling different modes of conditioning, and different generation tasks.

To tackle a key challenge in Text2Motion, the deficiency of 3D human motions and their corresponding textual descriptions, we built a novel large-scale 3D human motion dataset, LaViMo, extracted from in-the-wild web videos and action recognition datasets. LaViMo is approximately 3.3 times larger and encompasses a much broader range of actions than the largest available 3D motion dataset. We then introduce a novel multi-task framework TMT (Text Motion Translator), aimed at generating faithful 3D human motions from natural language descriptions, especially focusing on complicated actions and those not existing in the training set. In contrast to prior works, TMT is uniquely regularized by multiple tasks, including Text2Motion, Motion2Text, Text2Text, and Motion2Motion. This multi-task regularization significantly bolsters the model’s robustness and enhances its ability of motion modeling and semantic understanding. Additionally, we devised an augmentation method for the textual descriptions using Large Language Models. This augmentation significantly enhances the model’s capability to interpret open-vocabulary descriptions while generating motions. The results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling diverse and novel motion descriptions, laying a strong foundation for future research in the field.","authors":["Yijun Qian","Jack Urbanek","Alexander Hauptmann","Jungdam Won"],"year":2024,"month":11,"url":"https://eccv.ecva.net/virtual/2024/poster/266","survey":false,"survey_abbr":"","model":true,"model_abbr":"TMT","dataset":true,"dataset_abbr":"LaViMo","submission":"ECCV","submission_year":"2024","page":"","repo":"","backbone_tags":"LLM, VQ-VAE","approach_tags":"Multi-Task"},{"arxiv_id":"non-arxiv4","title":"Towards Emotion-enriched Text-to-Motion Generation via LLM-guided Limb-level Emotion Manipulating\\n","abstract":"In the literature, existing studies on text-to-motion generation (TMG) routinely focus on exploring the objective alignment of text and motion, which largely ignore the subjective emotion information, especially the limb-level emotion information. With this in mind, this paper proposes a new Emotion-enriched Text-to-Motion Generation (ETMG) task, aiming to generate motions with the subjective emotion information. Further, this paper believes that injecting emotions into limbs (named intra-limb emotion injection) and ensuring the coordination and coherence of emotional motions after injecting emotion information (named inter-limb emotion disturbance) is rather important and challenging in this ETMG task. To this end, this paper proposes an LL M-guided Limb-level Emotion Manipulating ( L3 EM) approach to ETMG. Specifically, this approach designs an LLM-guided intra-limb emotion modeling block to inject emotion into limbs, followed by a graph-structured inter-limb relation modeling block to ensure the coordination and coherence of emotional motions. Particularly, this paper constructs a coarse-grained Emotional Text-to-Motion (EmotionalT2M) dataset and a fine-grained Limb -level Emotional Text-to-Motion (Limb-ET2M) dataset to justify the effectiveness of the proposed L3EM approach. Detailed evaluation demonstrates the significant advantage of our L3EM approach to ETMG over the state-of-the-art baselines. This justifies the importance of the limb-level emotion information for ETMG and the effectiveness of our L3EM approach in coherently manipulating such information.","authors":["Tan Yu","Jingjing Wang","Jiawen Wang","Jiamin Luo","Guodong Zhou"],"year":2024,"month":10,"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3664647.3681487","survey":false,"survey_abbr":"","model":true,"model_abbr":"L3EM","dataset":true,"dataset_abbr":"Limb-ET2M","submission":"MM","submission_year":"2024","page":"","repo":"https://github.com/aekx/L3EM","backbone_tags":"CLIP, LLM, Diffusion","approach_tags":"Graph"},{"arxiv_id":"non-arxiv5","title":"M-Adaptor: Text-driven Whole-body Human Motion Generation","abstract":"Text-driven whole-body human motion generation, which involves the creation of motion sequences based on textual descriptions, has attracted much attention in the communities of computer vision and artificial intelligence.

Researchers have recently developed large-scale 3D expressive whole-body motion datasets enriched with semantic labels and pose descriptions. Nonetheless, there remains a considerable demand within the community for a straightforward and effective framework for generating and evaluating whole-body human motion based on textual descriptions. To address the above issues, we introduce M-Adaptor, a two-stage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based generator for whole-body motion generation tasks, to improve the quality and diversity of body motions, facial expressions, and hand gestures. In particular, it first generates initial coarse-grained body motion tokens from textual prompts to enhance the stability of generated motions, then iterates fine-grained facial expressions with the LoRA-based adaptor to enhance motion expressiveness. Furthermore, we extend the existing state-of-the-art CLaM model to CLaM-H and CLaM-X for evaluation of SMPL-H and SMPL-X based motion generation.

In recent years, human motion generation from natural language has emerged as a promising alternative to costly and labor-intensive data collection methods relying on motion capture or wearable sensors (e.g., suits). Despite this, generating human motion from textual descriptions remains a challenging and intricate task, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale supervised datasets capable of capturing the full diversity of human activity.This study proposes a new approach, called MotionGPT, to address the limitations of previous text-based human motion generation methods by utilizing the extensive semantic information available in large language models (LLMs). We first pretrain a doubly text-conditional motion diffusion model on both coarse (\\"high-level\\") and detailed (\\"low-level\\") ground truth text data. Then during inference, we improve motion diversity and alignment with the training set, by zero-shot prompting GPT-3 for additional \\"low-level\\" details.

However, existing approaches typically rely on supervised style learning with labeled datasets, constraining their adaptability and generalization for effective diverse style control. Additionally, they have not fully explored the temporal correlations between motion, textual descriptions, and style, making it challenging to generate semantically consistent motion with precise style alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel method that integrates unsupervised style from arbitrary references into a text-driven diffusion model to generate semantically consistent stylized human motion. The core innovation lies in leveraging text as a mediator to capture the temporal correspondences between motion and style, enabling the seamless integration of temporally dynamic style into motion features. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model on a text-motion dataset to capture the correlation between motion and text semantics. A style adapter then extracts temporally dynamic style features from reference motions and integrates a novel Semantic-Aware Style Injection (SASI) module to infuse these features into the diffusion model. The SASI module computes the semantic correlation between motion and style features based on texts, selectively incorporating style features that align with motion content, ensuring semantic consistency and precise style alignment. Our style adapter does not require a labeled style dataset for training, enhancing adaptability and generalization of style control.
